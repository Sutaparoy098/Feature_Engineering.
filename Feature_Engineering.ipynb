        "\n",
        "- Weights in a linear regression model: These weights determine the strength of the relationship between features and the target variable.\n",

        "- **Negative correlation:** Values of one variable move in the opposite direction of the other (e.g., as study time increases, test anxiety might decrease).\n",

        "- **One-hot encoding:** Converts each category into a binary vector where only the relevant category has a value of 1 and others are 0. This works well for many algorithms.\n",
        "- **Label encoding:** Assigns a numerical value to each category. Be cautious of interpreting order in this case, as it might not reflect reality.\n",

        "**7. Training and Testing:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Training set:** Used to teach the model the underlying patterns in the data. The model learns by adjusting its parameters to minimize the loss on this data.\n",
        "- **Testing set:** Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, simulating real-world use cases. It's crucial not to use the testing data for training to avoid overfitting (where the model memorizes the training data but doesn't generalize well).\n",
